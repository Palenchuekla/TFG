# TFG
José Antonio López Palenzuela bachelor's thesis repository. The goal of the project is to implement a ML/DL model that correctly estimates a person's legal age (over or under 18) based on a panoramic radiography of it's teeth (ortopantomographies). In other words, a binary classifer of images. Images used to implement the actual models can not be included for obvious reasons. Keeping this in mind, this repository stores a copy of the implemented software that can be used outside this project along with some examples of use that do not contain sensible data.

# Repository Content
- `env.yml`: Exported conda enviroment to get all packages, libraries and dependencies needed to use project's code.
- `code/utilites`: Folder containing the key funtionalities of the project.
- `code/notebooks`: Folder containing Jupyter Notebooks that use this functionalities. These notebooks are similar to the ones used dto generate the project actual results, but they are more documented/commented to guide the reader through the process. Also, some notebooks couldn't be included cause they showed sensitive data.
- `results`: Folder containing the results of some the `code/utilities` notebooks.
