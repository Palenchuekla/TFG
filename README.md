José Antonio López Palenzuela bachelor's thesis repository. The goal of the project is to implement a ML/DL model that correctly stimates a person's legal age (over or under 18) based on a panoramic radiography of it's teeth (ortopantomographies): a binary classifer of images. Images used to implement the actual models can not be included for obvious reasons. Keeping this in mind, this repository stores a copy of the implemented software that can be used outside this project and scropts/notebooks that do not work or contain sensitive data.
